      okay, I hope you can can make time to read this. tenang aja, gak bikin ngantuk kaya kalkulus xixi. been watching you for 2 years and i think it's time to say it. i will always remember how I'd go to school happily just to see you being so cute yet charismatic. i don't even understand how a person can be this perfect. the way you talk, the way you walk, and the way you treat people, that somehow trapped me in this feeling. you've always been my motivation to be a better person. incase you don't know, that's how cool you are. anyways, semangat kuliahnya ya! i don't know when will we see each other again. so I hope you enjoy your college life, make lot of friends, and met good people. oh, and you're GOATED for that 468 score di skd!!!! you worked hard and you deserve it much! good luck for the next selections for kedinasan yaaaaa!! 
      
      by the way, if you're uncomfortable of these things, just let me know, okay? just so i know my limits. that's it. dadaaaah, stay healthy, stay sigma, and be happy, Sipil!
